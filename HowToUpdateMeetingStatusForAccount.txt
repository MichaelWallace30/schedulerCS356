How to update meeting sttaua of account and meeting based on accepeting or declineing meetings

Account has two meeting list:

	meetingList
	invitedMeetingList
	
	When a meeting is created it automatically changes an accounts invitedMeetingList by 
	entity object meeting checking its own invited list.
	
When an account logs in it should check its invitedMeetingList and force the account to accept or decline:

	data base method should be used:
		updateAccountMeetingAttendenceStatus(Account account, Meeting meeting, Boolean attedningMeetingBoolean)
		
		
		
		EX:
		
		Account myAccount = getAccount(id form login controller);
		db = data base controller;
		
		LinkedList<Meeting> invitedList = myAccount.getInvitedMeetingList();
		
		for each tempMeeting in invitedList
		{		
			
			//display and get decission from user on gui level
			Boolean accepetedInvited = gui bs get response;
						
			//this method will remove the meeting from account invited list and decide if it should
			//go into the meeting list. It will also update the meetings lists
			db.updateAccountMeetingAttendenceStatus(myAccount, tempMeeting, acceptedInvited);
		
		}
		
		//don't set any meeting lists for account or meeting it is done in above method
		//not need to update on db level it is done for you, but if you do it won't be a problem
